# To-Do-Task-App-with-Oracle-Apex
In this video, I demonstrate how Oracle APEX allows extensive template customization. I created a simple TO-DO TASK system to implement the concept of template customization in Oracle APEX. The region type used is Classic Report but the report template that define the appearance and layout of this classic report is an edited Medi List template.

Highlights:

Custom Task List Layout: We leveraged Oracle APEX template options to create a clean and easy-to-use interface for displaying tasks.

Dynamic Icons and Buttons: Custom logic was added to dynamically change the states of icons and buttons based on task status and priority.

Enhanced User Experience: Through customization, we improved the visual appearance and usability of the system, making it more user-friendly for users.

Oracle APEX provides the flexibility to tailor templates to fit specific project needs, which was helpful in delivering a polished and functional application.
